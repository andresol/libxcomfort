libxcomfort
===========

Aiming to become an library for controlling Moeller / Eaton XComfort devices through the USB/RS232 dongle.
Their proprietary protocol has to be understood first. Working RS232 packet for setting a dimmer actuator to a desired level has been implemented.

The goal is that it can be used with CKOZ-00/03 and possibly CRSZ-00/01 for controlling actuators from linux/other OS'es.
